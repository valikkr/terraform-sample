## Description

The repo contains the next components:
- Application itself
- Terragrunt deployment configuration
- Terraform modules
	- Cluster - Creates a ECS Cluster and related services
	- Codebuild - Creates an AWS Codebuild job which starts automatically when code pushed to "develop" branch
	- ECR - Creates an Elastic Container repository
	- Init-Build - Builds and deploys initial image to ECR when new repository is created

## Folders and Files

- /app - Main Application folder
- /providers - Terragrunt directory
    - ./dev - DEV environment configuration
        - ./codebuild - Terragrunt configuration for "codebuild" module
	    - ./ecr - Terragrunt configuration for "ecr" module
	    - ./ecs-cluster - Terragrunt configuration for "cluster" module
	    - ./init-build - Terragrunt configuration for "init-build" module
	    - ./buildspec.yml - Build SPEC for AWS Codebuild
	    - ./terragrunt.hcl - Main Terragrunt configuration file for "DEV" environment. Contains variable values.
	    - ./secrets.hcl - Contains secrets. File is not in repo because it is added to .gitignore. Should be created manually.
- /modules - Terraform modules

## Configuration

Main configuration files are the next:

/providers/dev/terragrunt.hcl - Contains main variables for Terragrunt & Terraform:
- remote_state_bucket - S3 bucket for Terraform states
- envorinment - Environment name (dev, prod, etc)
- app_name - Name of Application (will be used for naming AWS resources)
- image_tag - Default value for Docker image tag. Will be used for initial build
- repo_url - GitHub repo URL
- aws_profile - The name of [AWS Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)
- aws_account - AWS Account ID
- aws_region - AWS Region for creating resources
- branch_pattern - Which branch changes should webhook watch on (e.g.: "^refs/heads/develop$")
- git_trigger_event - Event for [git webhook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_WebhookFilter.html) 

You can set variable value during terragrunt run to override configuration. For example:

`terragrunt apply -var="app_name=MY_VALUE"`

/providers/dev/buildspec.yml - Pipeline file for AWS Codebuild. 

## Deployment

### Preparation

 - Install the required versions of Terragrunt and Terraform 
 - Configure AWS Cli for your account (see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html))
 - Download the repo content
 - Update "locals" block in providers/dev/terragrunt.hcl file
 - Obtaint [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
 - Create "secrets.hcl" file and add Github token:

`inputs = {
  github_oauth_token = "GITHUB_TOKEN"
}
`

> If you want to change Application name, environment name or region do not forget to update buildspec.yml before deploying from sratch. If you want to change parameters when infrastructure already deployed, it will delete all of existing resources and deploy new infrastructure and application.

### One command deployment

 - Go to the /providers/dev directory and run:

`terragrunt run-all init`

- Then...

`terragrunt run-all plan`

- And if there is no issues in generated plan:

`terragrunt run-all apply`

### Step by step deployment

Step by step deployment should be done in the next order:

1. ECR creation (`providers/dev/ecr`)
2. Initial build (`providers/dev/init-build`)
3. Cluster creation (`providers/dev/ecs-cluster`)
4. Codebuild job setup (`providers/dev/codebuild`)

Go to each folder one by one and run:

`terragrunt plan`

- When plan is completed run:

`terragrunt apply`

- Go to the next directory when deployment completed. 

When resources creation is finished you can push a new version to "develop" branch of the repo you described in `env.hcl` file to initiate a new build 

### Destroy infrastructure

You can destroy everything you deployed with the next command which should be executed in `dev/` directory:

`terraform run-all destroy`

Or you can destroy components step by step in reverse order from deployment. Go to the appropriate directory and run:

`terragrunt destroy`
